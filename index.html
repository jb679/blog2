                    Hi, and thanks for visiting my blog post. I'm excited! I read somewhere that it would be a great idea to document the journey and it's good for self-discipline and learning so here goes.This is my first actual post on anything regarding my web development path. This is also my first real design on anything. It seems pretty simple to the reader, I am sure. However, it's still my very first project! I'll be formatting more later on with my other projects to make sure they are properly done and look professional. In the meantime, I'm very grateful that you're reading these few short lines and hopefully I will be able to have you look at more of my portfolio and see what I've done and how I've progressed. I'll spice up this page more and have it looking more professional also. The below links will work just as soon as I get my social media profile up and operating.

                    Well, here we are again and wow it's been quite a journey so far. I've been very busy and feel like i'm being rather productive, especially going the self-taught route. I've managed to build a pretty expansive game in javascript, I have started a portfolio page using codepen.io, a responsive gastronomia web page, and a few other little games and sites as well! It's been very engaging for me and soon I will study more vanilla javascript (no frameworks) to try and hone my skills a bit more. Perhaps I will check back in and be able to update further!

                   It's certainly been fun and I've been working a lot on this as it's very important to me. The internet is interesting! There's a wealth of information out there. Of course, this can also be a bit debilitating at times because often the question isn't where to find the information ... but rather, which of these is the <i>correct</i> information? I feel i'm certainly fortunate to be present in the technological era but wow, it can also be a bit daunting at times. Anyways, I've had a good bit of practice with html and css and I've now been building some projects with javascript. It's definitely different, I must say! But boy oh boy, the power of Javascript is pretty awesome I have to admit.
